I am an undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I’m pursuing my a Bachelor’s degree at IIT Bombay with my major in Aerospace Engineering and minors in Computer Science.

I’m quite new to coding, but I have loved it right from the day I was introduced to it. I like to do things differently and search for a new innovative solution for every problem I encounter.
